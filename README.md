# Shepherd-Simulator--Game-Jam-1
This is the first game created from scratch based on the roll-a-ball assignment in Unity. Created in 5 days by a team of 3.
IMPORTANT: Due to file size, the Unity player had to be removed from the file. Please extract this application from previous Unity projects if not already installed on your computer. Thank you!
